The Scotty REVOLUTION Network Management Tool is a complete rewrite of
the ancient Scotty and Tkined Network Management Tools.

The Scotty and Tkined Network Management Tools were developed by
Juergen Schoenwaelder and many contributors.

I did some improvements on the graphical frontend in the year 2008.

I'd tried to rewrite it the first time using Ruby till the beginning of
the year 2010. Although it had an advanced featureset (client/server
design using Ruby Tuble Spaces, Linux/Win32 GUI clients, ...) it had
some performance/bandwidth issues and no designer gui.

In the meantime, due the development of websockets and other advanced web
techniques Scotty REVOLUTION is born - another complete rewrite in Perl
using a 3 Tier design and advanced web techniques.
